## Hi!  I'm Chris Capps. :wave:


### üßî‚Äç About Me 
Both my personal and professional lives have been largely focused on the intersection of art and technology. 
I've always been interested in the way computers work, and played around with basic 
(and BASIC) programming principles when I was young, but some of my first serious forays into coding 
came as a student of electronic music, finding ways to push equipment beyond its intended purpose
or incorporate technology into my workflow that wasn't explicitly musical.

Transitioning my career towards the latter part of the "art meets tech" continuum has allowed me 
to bring into focus something I'm especially passionate about - the art of craftsmanship. 
Whether it's a perfectly written pop song, a clever piece of marketing, or a particularly elegant bit of code, 
I'm interested in creating beautiful things that don't just happen to be useful, but rather that derive their beauty specifically from their utility.
